 <!-- üß© Real-World Style Challenge: Event Handlers & this
Imagine you're creating a simple DOM app (e.g., in the browser) that renders buttons and attaches click handlers. Here's the problem: -->

<div id="button-container"></div>
<script>
const buttonManager = {
  label: 'Click Me',
  renderButtons: function () {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
      const btn = document.createElement('button');
      btn.textContent = `${this.label} ${i}`;
      
      btn.addEventListener('click', function () {
        console.log(`Button ${i} clicked - ${this.label}`);
      });

      document.getElementById('button-container').appendChild(btn);
    }
  }
};

buttonManager.renderButtons();
</script>

<!-- ü§î What will happen when you click each button? -->
"undefined followed by 1 or 2 or 3"
i is from the outer loop, so it works just fine.
But this.label becomes undefined because this refers to the button element, not buttonManager
all of this as we are using regular function expression not arrow fn 

<!-- What will be printed when each button is clicked? -->
Button 1 clicked - undefined
Button 2 clicked - undefined
Button 3 clicked - undefined


<!-- Why doesn‚Äôt it print what we expect? -->
In this case, since the function is attached as an event listener,
this refers to the element that triggered the event ‚Äî which is the button itself. 
So this.label is looking for a label property on the button DOM element, which doesn‚Äôt exist ‚áí undefined.



<!-- How can you fix it so the output becomes like: -->
Button 1 clicked - Click Me
Button 2 clicked - Click Me
Button 3 clicked - Click Me

‚ÄúReplace regular function with arrow function‚Äù
 Because arrow functions don‚Äôt have their own this, they inherit it from the surrounding scope
